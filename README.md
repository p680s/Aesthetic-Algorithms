# Visualizing Sorting Algorithms
This application is a visualizer for popular sorting algorithms. 

Version 1 includes insertion sort and two versions of quicksort ("standard" and taking the median of three). Written in React and Typescript, this app implements asynchronous functions to allow for better understanding of how the algorithms process the data by slowing down the sorting and visualizing it in a bar graph. 

Live demo to be uploaded.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This will run the app locally.
